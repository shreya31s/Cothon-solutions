## TASK 1: Sales Forecasting Project

### Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust sales forecasting model using historical sales data. The goal is to predict future sales, allowing businesses to make informed decisions about inventory, budgeting, and planning. Various statistical and machine learning techniques, including ARIMA, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are applied to analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns in the data.

### Technologies and Tools Used

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks:
- Time Series Analysis: Statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMA, seasonal decomposition)
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest), XGBoost
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Development Environment: Google Colab

### Key Features

1. End-to-End Data Pipeline:
Data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization.

2. Time Series Forecasting:
Implementation of ARIMA for short-term forecasting.
Handling of insufficient data through moving average trends.

3. Machine Learning Models:
Application of Random Forest and XGBoost for non-linear sales prediction.

4. Visualization and Insights:
Line plots, heatmaps, and trend decomposition to visualize sales patterns and forecast accuracy.

5. Error Handling:
Dynamic detection and renaming of date columns.
Handling empty dataframes post-resampling.
Alternative strategies for limited data scenarios.

### Dataset

- Source: The dataset stores_sales_forecasting.csv contains historical sales data.

- Columns:
    - Order Date – Date of sales transaction.
    - Sales – Total sales amount.
    - Category, Sub-Category – Product classification.
    - Additional columns for customer, region, and product information.

### Project Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values using forward fill (ffill).
   - Conversion of non-numeric data to numeric values.
   - Date conversion and resampling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualization of sales trends over time.
   - Heatmap for correlation analysis.

3. Model Development:
   - ARIMA for time series modeling.
   - Random Forest and XGBoost for non-linear regression.

4. Evaluation:
   - Forecasting and comparison with actual data.
   - Visualization of predictions.

### Error Handling and Solutions

- Insufficient Data for ARIMA:
Use moving average when data points are fewer than 24.

- KeyErrors for Missing Columns:
Dynamic detection and renaming of date and sales columns.

- Empty Dataframes Post-Resampling:
Early checks to handle empty resampled data.

###b Visualizations

- Sales Trend Over Time
- Moving Average Trend (for insufficient data)
- Heatmap for Feature Correlation

### Results

- Accurate Sales Forecasting using ARIMA and Random Forest models.
- Robustness to handle incomplete or limited data scenarios.
  
### Future Enhancements

  - Integration of deep learning models (LSTM) for more accurate long-term forecasting.
  - Expansion of datasets to improve model generalization.
  - Deployment of the model as a web-based forecasting tool.
